PULL UP COFFEE — GROK HANDOFF PROMPT (SECOND-PASS IMPROVEMENT)

You are a senior startup product architect + legal-ops strategist + scaling engineer.
Your task is to take an existing Gemini Deep Think output and improve it materially.
Do not repeat generic advice. Be specific, practical, and implementation-ready.

====================================================
1) BUSINESS + PRODUCT CONTEXT
====================================================
Business: Pull Up Coffee Pty Ltd (Australia-first, then global)
Core concept: Virtual drive-thru for cafes without requiring a physical drive-thru lane.
Customer flow: parked customer orders via web, pays, and collects curbside.
Merchant value: better margin profile vs major delivery marketplaces, faster queue handling, improved accessibility.

Positioning themes:
- Street parking is now your drive-thru
- Accessibility + inclusion
- Faster service + lower friction
- Better economics for independent cafes

====================================================
2) CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION SNAPSHOT
====================================================
Frontend:
- Next.js 16 App Router
- Main experience in app/page.tsx
- React 19 + TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind v4

Backend/API:
- Next API routes under app/api
- Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- Firebase Admin for server-side admin operations
- Stripe (checkout + connect + capture/cancel/confirm)
- Twilio SMS API route
- Route security: origin checks + JSON content-type checks + in-memory rate limiting

Security:
- Access gate cookie with HMAC signature
- Proxy route lock for non-access routes
- Admin token auth for admin endpoints
- CSP + HSTS + secure headers in next.config
- ALLOWED_ORIGINS + inferred Vercel fallback logic

Ops direction:
- Wants automation-first operation with low founder overhead
- Wants clear controls for anti-fraud, abuse prevention, and business verification

====================================================
3) KEY BUSINESS/OPS LOGIC TO CONSIDER
====================================================
- Dynamic curbside fee model
- Early adopter economics path + later sustainability model
- Merchant payout preference fields (daily/weekly/fortnightly) in UI context
- Affiliate incentive logic exists in legal/support content and SOP notes
- GPS discovery + radius logic + suburb/postcode UX (recently improved)
- Tracking flow includes movement thresholds and automatic arrival/updates behavior
- Twilio used for selected operational notifications, with simulated fallback when creds absent

====================================================
4) DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE IN PROJECT (REFERENCE CONTEXT)

- next.config.ts

====================================================
5) WHAT I NEED FROM YOU NOW (SECOND-PASS)
====================================================
I already got a Gemini Deep Think answer.
You must improve it, tighten it, and remove weak/generalized recommendations.

Required output sections:
1. Executive Reality Check
2. Priority Matrix (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
3. Product/UX upgrades (mobile-first, old-device-friendly)
4. GPS/discovery and checkout/payment trust flow improvements
5. Security + abuse prevention hardening roadmap
6. Legal policy rewrite quality control (AU-first), including liability boundaries and platform-role clarity
7. Unit economics and sustainability stress test (conservative/base/aggressive)
8. App-store path (PWA vs RN/Expo vs wrapper) with recommendation + milestones
9. Operations automation model (founder-light)
10. 30/60/90 day execution plan with measurable KPIs and go/no-go gates

For each recommendation provide:
- Why this matters
- Effort estimate (S/M/L)
- Impact estimate (Low/Med/High)
- Dependencies
- Acceptance criteria

====================================================
6) QUALITY BAR
====================================================
- Assume founder needs practical, copy/paste-ready guidance.
- No fluff.
- Flag contradictions between strategy, legal position, and code reality.
- Call out high-risk assumptions explicitly.
- Provide decision trees where there is uncertainty.

====================================================
7) INPUTS FOR YOU TO ANALYZE
====================================================
A) ORIGINAL MASTER PROMPT (used with Gemini):

B) GEMINI RESPONSE (to improve):

[PASTE GEMINI RESPONSE HERE]

====================================================
8) FINAL INSTRUCTION
====================================================
Produce a better version than Gemini’s output, optimized for:
- founder speed,
- legal defensibility,
- secure and scalable operations,
- premium UX,
- realistic profitability.

End with a compact "Week 1 Implementation Pack" that can be executed in VS Code immediately.
