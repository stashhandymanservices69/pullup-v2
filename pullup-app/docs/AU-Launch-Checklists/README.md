# AU Launch Checklists (Pull Up Coffee)

This folder contains the execution checklists discussed for launching Pull Up Coffee in Australia first.

## Files
- `01-AU-Launch-GoLive-Checklist.md` — everything required to launch live and functional in Australia.
- `02-Post-Launch-Workload-Runbook.md` — realistic workload after launch and daily/weekly operating cadence.
- `03-Accounting-Setup-MVP-AU.md` — minimum viable accounting setup to avoid cleanup pain later.
- `04-Expansion-Path-AU-to-US.md` — when and how to expand from AU to US safely.

## Recommended order
1. Complete `01-AU-Launch-GoLive-Checklist.md`
2. Complete `03-Accounting-Setup-MVP-AU.md`
3. Start `02-Post-Launch-Workload-Runbook.md` on launch day
4. Use `04-Expansion-Path-AU-to-US.md` only after AU stability KPIs are met
