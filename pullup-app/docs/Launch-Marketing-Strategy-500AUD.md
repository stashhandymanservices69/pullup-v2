## Week 1: Personal Hustle ($0)

**Goal:** 5 cafes signed up from personal network + cold visits

### Day 1–2: Warm Outreach (5 hours)
Send personal messages to 50 people:

```
Hey [Name]! I just launched Pull Up Coffee — it lets cafes
take orders from customers in their cars. No app needed,
no delivery fees. If you know any cafe owners I'd love an
intro. First 33 cafes get the early-adopter rate (basically
free). Check it out: pullupcoffee.com.au
```

**Target:** 50 messages → 10 responses → 3 intros → 2 signups

### Day 3–5: Cold Cafe Visits (10 hours)
- Visit 20 cafes during 2–4pm (quiet period)
- Ask for the owner/manager
- 2-minute pitch → leave business card + QR poster
- Follow up next day via Google Maps listing email

**Pitch:**
> "Hi, I'm Steven. I built a platform that lets your customers
> order coffee from their car — like a drive-through but without
> needing a drive-through lane. Customer scans a QR code, orders
> on their phone, pays securely, you get a notification. No app
> download. You keep 100% of the sale. First 33 cafes join at our
> early-adopter rate. Can I show you a 30-second demo?"

**Target:** 20 visits → 8 conversations → 3 signups

### Day 6–7: Social Media Launch
**LinkedIn post #1** (personal account — founders get 5x engagement vs company pages):
```
I just launched Pull Up Coffee 🚗☕

The problem: Uber Eats charges cafes 30%. Most lose money on
every delivery order.

My solution: Customers scan a QR code from their car, order on
mobile web, pay via Stripe. Cafe gets notified instantly.
No app. No middleman. Cafe keeps 100%.

First 33 cafes join completely free (early-adopter program).

If you know an Aussie cafe owner, please tag them below.

#australianstartup #supportlocal #smallbusiness
```

**Facebook** — Post in 10 local cafe/business groups (value-first, not spammy)

**Instagram** — Launch with 3 posts: problem/solution, demo video, founder story

**Target:** 3 platforms × 200 reach = 600 impressions → 2 signups from DMs

### Week 1 Expected Result
| Channel | Signups |

## Post-33 Cafes: What's Next?

Once early-adopter spots are full:

1. **Announce scarcity:** "All 33 early-adopter spots are taken! Standard pricing starts next month."
2. **Waitlist:** Add a waitlist form for cafes who missed out — creates urgency for future cohorts
3. **Case studies:** Write 3 case studies from best-performing early cafes
4. **Expand geographically:** Target next city/region
5. **Re-invest revenue:** Month 2+ revenue funds Month 3 marketing (self-sustaining)

### Revenue Projection at 33 Cafes
- Average curbside fee: $3.00
- Platform share (20%): $0.60/order
- Average orders/cafe/day: 3
- Daily platform revenue: 33 × 3 × $0.60 = **$59.40/day**
- Monthly platform revenue: **~$1,782/month**
- Monthly costs (Vercel free, Firebase ~$25, Twilio ~$50): **~$75/month**
- **Net profit: ~$1,707/month** (after $500 marketing investment is recouped in <2 weeks)

---

## Emergency Pivots

### If signups are slow (< 3/week after Week 2):
- **Switch to warm intros only** — ask every signed-up cafe to introduce one peer
- **Offer setup concierge** — "I'll come to your cafe and set everything up in 15 minutes"
- **Extended trial** — "Try free for 90 days instead of 30"

### If cafes sign up but don't get orders:
- **Customer-side marketing** — Put up posters in the cafe's own window (customers see it on arrival)
- **Social post templates** — Give cafes a ready-to-post Instagram template: "Now accepting Pull Up orders! Skip the line by ordering from your car."
- **First-order incentive** — "Your first Pull Up order ships with a free cookie" (cafe provides, platform promotes)

### If budget runs out early:
- **Go 100% organic** — LinkedIn + cold visits are free and proven
- **Barter** — Offer free platform access in exchange for cafe-owner testimonial video
- **PR blitz** — Local media love "Aussie dad builds tech to save cafes" stories — free coverage

---

## Daily Routine (30 min/day)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 8:00am | Post on LinkedIn (pre-written, schedule with Buffer free) |
| 8:10am | Reply to all DMs, comments, emails |
| 8:20am | Check ad performance (pause if CPA > threshold) |
| 8:25am | Log metrics in Google Sheet |
| 8:30am | Done. Go build product or visit cafes. |

---

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Cafes signed up | 33 | Firestore `cafes` collection count |
| Time to 33 cafes | ≤ 8 weeks | Calendar |
| Total spend | ≤ $500 AUD | Receipt tracking |
| Paid CPA | < $42 | $500 / 12 paid signups |
| Blended CPA | < $16 | $500 / 33 total signups |
| First revenue | Within 14 days | Stripe dashboard |
| Cafe activation rate | > 70% | Cafes with ≥1 order / total cafes |
| Website conversion | > 5% | Signups / unique visitors |

---

**Bottom Line:** You have a proven product, bank-level security, and a generous early-adopter deal. $500 is enough to fill 33 spots if you lead with personal hustle (free channels first) and use paid ads only to fill the gaps. The product sells itself — you just need to get it in front of cafe owners.

**Created:** February 26, 2026  
**Budget:** $500 AUD (one-time, total)  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks  
**Goal:** 33 early-adopter cafes, $1,700+/month recurring revenue
