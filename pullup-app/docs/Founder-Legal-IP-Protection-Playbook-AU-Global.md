# Founder Legal + IP Protection Playbook (AU + Global)

This document is an operational checklist for launch. It is not legal advice.

## 1) Immediate Founder Protection (Do Before Public Launch)

- Register trade marks in Australia for:
  - `PULL UP COFFEE` word mark
  - Logo/device mark
  - Any key tagline used publicly
- File domain defensive registrations:
  - `.com.au`, `.com`, obvious typo variants, plural/singular variants
- Set up copyright ownership records:
  - keep dated evidence of code, product docs, launch docs, UI assets, brand assets
  - preserve git history and export periodic signed archives
- Execute IP assignment deeds with every contributor (employee, contractor, agency):
  - all code, designs, content, databases, know-how assigned to founder company
  - moral rights consents where permitted by law
- Execute confidentiality obligations (NDA/confidential information clauses) with:
  - contractors, agencies, partners, pilot cafes, advisors receiving non-public materials

## 2) Corporate + Contract Structure (Founder-Focused)

- Ensure product IP is owned by the company entity (not individuals personally).
- Ensure founder IP assignment into company is documented if early assets were created pre-incorporation.
- Ensure all contractor agreements include:
  - IP assignment
  - confidentiality
  - non-solicit (customers, suppliers, staff)
  - no re-use of proprietary playbooks, pricing logic, and private datasets
- Ensure all staff agreements include:
  - invention assignment
  - confidentiality
  - post-employment return/deletion obligations for confidential material

## 3) Public Terms Required for Enforceability

Publish and link these from footer + signup/checkout + cafe onboarding:

- Terms of Use
- Privacy Policy
- Cookie Notice
- Merchant/Cafe Partner Terms
- Acceptable Use Policy
- Intellectual Property + Brand Use Policy
- Takedown/Notice Policy

Core clauses to include in Terms and Partner Terms:

- clear ownership of platform IP, source code, brand, and data compilations
- limited license to users/cafes (non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable)
- express prohibition on copying, reverse engineering, scraping, model-training extraction, and benchmarking without consent
- anti-circumvention and anti-automation restrictions
- confidentiality around non-public business processes, pricing logic, and operations playbooks
- platform right to suspend/terminate for IP misuse or abuse
- limitation of liability and indemnities scoped to applicable law
- governing law + jurisdiction (Australia state/territory choice)

## 4) Australia-Specific Compliance Baseline

- Privacy Act 1988 obligations and APP-aligned handling for personal information.
- Spam Act compliance for SMS/email marketing consent and unsubscribe.
- Australian Consumer Law compliant representations, refund language, and unfair contract term review.
- If collecting payment data directly, confirm PCI scope and avoid storing sensitive card data in your platform.

## 5) Global Readiness Controls (When expanding beyond AU)

- Add region-specific privacy addenda before collecting users in those regions.
- Add DPA template for enterprise or high-volume cafe partners.
- Implement lawful cross-border transfer mechanism where required.
- Add rights request workflow for access/delete/correction requests.

## 6) Evidence + Enforcement Readiness

- Keep immutable evidence package updated monthly:
  - product screenshots by date
  - architecture/docs snapshots by date
  - launch announcements and campaign materials
  - git commit exports and release tags
- Set up brand/IP monitoring:
  - trade mark watch
  - app store and marketplace watch
  - domain watch for impersonation/typosquatting
- Prepare a legal response ladder:
  1. evidence capture
  2. cease-and-desist notice
  3. platform takedown notice
  4. interlocutory relief path through counsel

## 7) What Actually Makes Copying Hard

Ideas alone are hard to monopolize. Defensibility comes from combined layers:

- registered brand/trade marks
- strong contracts with assignment + confidentiality + usage restrictions
- proprietary operational data and partner network effects
- secure, fast product execution with protected know-how
- reliable compliance posture trusted by cafes and customers

## 8) Launch-Day Legal Gate (No-Go if Any Missing)

- [ ] Trade mark filing submitted for brand and logo in AU
- [ ] Founder/company IP chain-of-title complete
- [ ] Contractor/staff assignment deeds fully signed
- [ ] Public legal policies live and linked in production
- [ ] Terms acceptance capture enabled in key user flows
- [ ] Evidence archive generated and stored offsite
- [ ] External counsel has reviewed Terms/Privacy/Partner Terms for AU launch
