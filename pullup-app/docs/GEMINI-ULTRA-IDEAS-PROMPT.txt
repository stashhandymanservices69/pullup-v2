Use this as my technical co-pilot for Pull Up Coffee. Focus on implementation-ready outputs only.

Context:
- Next.js app router project with Firebase Auth/Firestore, Stripe Checkout/Connect, Twilio SMS, and admin API token layer.
- Goal: secure, scalable, production-grade launch.
- Constraints: no secret exposure, least-privilege access, strong validation, clear merchant UX.

Deliverables I want from you now:
1) Security hardening checklist mapped to code changes
- app-level, API-level, infra-level
- include exact headers, rate-limit strategy, App Check, Firestore rules, abuse prevention

2) Scalability plan for 100k users / 5k stores peak window
- bottlenecks and mitigations
- queueing strategy, retries, idempotency keys, webhook safety

3) Stripe + Printful automation roadmap
- manual MVP now, webhook automation later
- event matrix: payment_succeeded, fulfillment_created, tracking_updated, refund

4) Merchant operations UX improvements
- reduce confusion in dashboard
- payout clarity panel, order state machine, exception handling

5) SOP expansion pack
- add role-based SOPs: Founder, Ops, Support, Merchant
- include triggers, expected outcomes, rollback actions

Format required:
- Return as phased execution plan: Phase 1 (this week), Phase 2 (next week), Phase 3 (month)
- For each phase provide:
  - exact code tasks
  - test plan
  - risk level
  - success criteria

Important:
- Do not suggest exposing secrets in source code.
- Prefer secure defaults and minimal public attack surface.
- Assume Australian compliance baseline (ACL + Privacy Act alignment).
