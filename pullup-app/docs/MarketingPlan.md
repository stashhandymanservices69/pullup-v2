# Pull Up Coffee - Bootstrap Marketing Plan

**Philosophy:** Grow smart, not expensive. Leverage free channels first, paid ads only when proven.

**Budget:** $0-500/month (scale with revenue)

**Timeline:** Month 1 (free) → Month 2 ($100) → Month 3+ ($500)

**Goal:** 100 cafes in 90 days, $1,500/month revenue by Month 3

---

## Marketing Principles

### 1. Free First, Paid Later
- Exhaust free channels before spending money
- Test messaging with organic content before ads
- Pay only when you know what works

### 2. Local Over Global
- Target 30km radius (your city first)
- Word-of-mouth is powerful in cafe community
- One happy cafe refers 3 more

### 3. Show, Don't Tell
- Demo video > long explanation
- Customer testimonials > your claims
- Live orders > feature lists

### 4. Build in Public
- Share journey on LinkedIn (founders love this)
- Post metrics (transparently)
- Document challenges (authenticity builds trust)

---

## Week 1: $0 Budget (Launch Week)

**Goal:** Get first 5 cafes signed up from warm network

### Day 1-2: Personal Outreach (10 hours)
**Channels:**
- Personal Facebook/LinkedIn
- Family and friends
- Previous colleagues
- Local business contacts

**Message Template:**
```
Hey [Name]!

I just launched Pull Up Coffee - helping cafes do drive-through orders without apps or delivery fees.

If you know any cafe owners, I'd love an intro. First 100 cafes get free platform fees (only Stripe's 30¢ per transaction).

Check it out: pullupcoffee.com.au

Cheers!
```

**Target:** 50 messages sent → 10 responses → 3 cafe signups

---

### Day 3-4: Cafe Cold Visits (8 hours)
**Action Plan:**
1. Identify 20 cafes within 10km
2. Visit during slow hours (2-4pm)
3. Ask for owner/manager
4. 2-minute pitch + business card
5. Leave QR poster mockup

**Pitch Script:**
```
"Hi! I'm Steven. I built this platform that lets cafes do drive-through orders—like Uber Eats but without the 30% fees or apps.

Customer scans a QR code from their car, orders coffee, pays, drives up. You get notified instantly.

First 100 cafes join free. Interested?"
```

**Objection Handling:**
- "We're too busy" → "Perfect! That means more drive-through orders will help reduce line-ups"
- "Sounds complicated" → "It's simpler than Uber Eats. I'll set it up for you in 10 minutes"
- "We don't have drive-through" → "That's fine! Customers can park and walk up. It's basically pre-ordering"

**Target:** 20 visits → 5 conversations → 2 signups

---

### Day 5-7: Social Media Blitz (6 hours)
**Platforms:**
1. **LinkedIn** (best for B2B)
2. **Facebook** (local business groups)
3. **Instagram** (visual appeal)

**LinkedIn Posts (Daily):**
**Day 5:**
```
I just launched Pull Up Coffee to help Australian cafes compete with delivery apps 🚗☕

Problem: Uber Eats charges 30%. Most cafes lose money on every order.

Solution: Drive-through ordering without apps. Customers scan QR code, order, pay. Cafe gets 100% of the sale (just 30¢ Stripe fee).

First 100 cafes join completely free.

If you know a cafe owner, please tag them below!

```

**Day 6:**
```
Day 2 update: 3 cafes signed up! 🎉

Posted yesterday, got 12 intro requests. The cafe community is so supportive.

One owner said: "This is exactly what we needed. Uber Eats is killing our margins."

If you run a cafe or know someone who does, DM me. Happy to give a demo.

#startupjourney #buildinpublic
```

**Day 7:**
```
Quick demo: How Pull Up Coffee works (30-second video)

1. Customer drives up, scans QR poster
2. Browses menu, adds to cart (no app needed!)
3. Pays via Stripe (secure, instant)
4. Cafe gets notification, prepares order
5. Customer picks up (5 min average)

Simple. Fast. No middleman taking 30%.

Who should I talk to next? 👇

Hey everyone!

I built a free platform to help cafes do drive-through orders without apps.

Problem I'm solving: 
- Uber Eats charges 30% (most cafes lose money)
- Customers hate downloading apps for one cafe
- Phone orders are chaotic during rushes

My solution:
- Customer scans QR code from car (no app)
- Orders on mobile web
- Cafe gets 100% of sale (just 30¢ Stripe fee)
- First 100 cafes completely free

Would love feedback! pullupcoffee.com.au

(Mods: I'm not selling anything, genuinely asking for input from cafe owners)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Brisbane Dad Launches Tech Platform to Help Cafes Fight Delivery App Fees

[Your City], [Date] - Steven [Last Name], a local father and developer, has launched Pull Up Coffee, a platform that helps Australian cafes accept drive-through orders without the 30% fees charged by delivery apps.

"I watched my favorite cafes struggle with Uber Eats fees," says Steven. "They were losing money on every order. I built Pull Up so customers can order from their car - no app needed - and cafes keep 100% of the sale."

The platform launched [date] and has already signed up [X] cafes across [city]. First 100 cafes join completely free.

How it works: Customers scan a QR code from their car, browse the menu on mobile web, pay securely, and the cafe receives an instant notification. No app download required.

For more information: pullupcoffee.com.au
Contact: hello@pullupcoffee.com.au

###
```

**Expected:** 1-2 media mentions → 500-1,000 website visits → 5-8 cafes

---

## Organic Growth Strategies (Always Active)

### 1. Referral Program (Cafe-to-Cafe)
**Mechanic:**
- Existing cafe refers new cafe
- New cafe signs up with referral code
- Both cafes get $20 credit (towards SMS costs or platform fees)

**Promotion:**
- Email existing cafes: "Know another cafe that needs Pull Up? Refer them and both get $20!"
- In-dashboard banner: "Refer a friend, earn $20"
- Business card back: "Refer businesses, earn 25%"

**Expected:** 10% of cafes refer 1 cafe each
- Month 2: 35 cafes × 10% = 3 referrals
- Month 3: 60 cafes × 10% = 6 referrals
- Month 4: 100 cafes × 10% = 10 referrals/month (ongoing!)

**Cost:** 10 referrals × $40 (both sides) = $400/month
**Revenue:** 10 referrals × $18/month = $180/month
**Net:** -$220 first month, then +$180/month forever (great LTV!)

---

### 2. Content SEO (Long-Term Play)
**Write 20 high-quality blog articles:**
- "How to Increase Cafe Revenue by 30%"
- "Drive-Through Coffee Setup Guide"
- "Uber Eats Alternative for Small Cafes"
- "Customer Pre-Ordering: The Ultimate Guide"
- "Coffee Shop Technology Trends 2026"

**SEO Strategy:**
- Target long-tail keywords (low competition, high intent)
- Internal linking (build site authority)
- Backlinks (guest post on cafe blogs)

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to rank
**Expected:** Months 6+: 500 organic visitors/month → 10 cafes/month (free!)

---

### 3. Customer-Generated Marketing
**Strategy:** Happy customers promote for you

**Tactics:**
- Ask cafes to post about Pull Up (provide templates)
- Customer testimonial videos (offer $50 gift card)
- User-generated content (repost cafe photos using Pull Up)

**Example Email to Cafe:**
```
Hi [Cafe Name]!

We noticed you've had 20 orders through Pull Up this week - amazing! 🎉

Would you be willing to share your experience? A quick social media post or 2-minute video would help other cafes discover us.

We'll feature you on our homepage and send you $50 in free SMS credits.

Let me know!
```

**Expected:** 5 cafes post/month × 1,000 followers = 5,000 impressions → 2 cafes

---

### 4. Community Building
**Private Facebook Group:**
- "Pull Up Cafe Owners"
- Share tips, success stories, feature requests
- Weekly check-in (post your week's revenue!)
- Exclusive perks (early access to features)

**Benefits:**

| 2/24 | 5 | 2 | 3 | $36 | $0 | $7.20 |
| 2/25 | 8 | 5 | 12 | $144 | $0 | $28.80 |
| 2/26 | 13 | 10 | 25 | $300 | $0 | $60 |

**Formulas:**
- Active Cafes: `=COUNTIF(Orders!CafeID, ">0")` (cafes with 1+ order)
- Revenue: `=SUM(Orders!Total)` (where date = today)
- Profit: `=Revenue * 0.20 - Spend - (SMS_Count * 0.10) - Firebase_Cost`

---

### Channel Performance Tracker

| Channel | Spend | Signups | CPA | Revenue | ROI |
|---------|-------|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| LinkedIn | $0 | 15 | $0 | $270 | ∞ |
| Facebook Ads | $200 | 20 | $10 | $360 | 1.8x |

- Revenue: `=Signups * 18` (avg monthly revenue per cafe)
- ROI: `=Revenue / Spend`

---

### Conversion Funnel

```
1,000 website visitors
    ↓ (5% click signup)
    50 signup page views
    ↓ (40% complete form)
    20 applications submitted
    ↓ (80% approved)
    16 cafes approved
    ↓ (70% go live)
    11 active cafes
```

**Optimize Each Step:**
- Low signup clicks? → Improve landing page CTA
- Low form completions? → Simplify form (remove fields)
- Low approval rate? → Better pre-qualification (ABN check on form)
- Low activation? → Better onboarding email sequence

---

## Crisis Marketing (If Growth Stalls)

### Scenario: Stuck at 50 Cafes for 2 Weeks

**Diagnosis:**
- Check: Are existing cafes getting orders?
- Check: Is word-of-mouth happening?
- Check: Are ads still converting?

**Possible Causes:**
1. Market saturation (all nearby cafes already signed up)
2. Poor product experience (cafes not getting orders)
3. Pricing concerns (cafes think it's too expensive)
4. Competition (someone else launched similar)

**Solutions:**
1. **Expand Radius:** Target next city (30-50km away)
2. **Improve Activation:** Call each inactive cafe, personally help them
3. **Price Promotion:** "Next 50 cafes get 60 days free SMS"
4. **Feature Launch:** Add highly requested feature, promote heavily

---

## Budget Scenarios

### Conservative Growth (Profitable by Month 2)
- **Month 1:** $0 spend, 15 cafes → $270/month revenue

- **Month 3:** $300 spend, 60 cafes → $1,080/month revenue, $650/month profit

**Total Investment:** $400
**Breakeven:** Month 2 (pay back month 1-2 costs by Month 3)

---

### Aggressive Growth (Scale Fast, Profitable Month 4)

## Marketing Principles Refresher

### 1. Focus on Retention, Not Just Acquisition
- **Bad:** Sign up 100 cafes, 50 churn (net 50)
- **Good:** Sign up 60 cafes, 5 churn (net 55)

**Actions:**
- Weekly check-in with inactive cafes
- Monthly newsletter with tips
- Respond to support within 4 hours
- Add requested features promptly

---

### 2. Build Network Effects
**Goal:** Each new cafe makes platform more valuable

**How:**
- Customer sees 20 cafes nearby (vs 2) = more likely to use
- More customers = more orders = caffes happier = more referrals

**Virtuous Cycle:**
```
More cafes → More customers discover platform
    ↓
More customers → More orders per cafe
    ↓
Happier cafes → Refer other cafes
    ↓
More cafes (loop back to top)
```

### 3. Track Cohorts, Not Just Totals
**Example:**
- Cafes signed up in January: 80% still active in March
- Cafes signed up in February: 60% still active in March
- **Insight:** January onboarding was better (what changed in Feb?)

**Action:** Improve February's onboarding to match January's
