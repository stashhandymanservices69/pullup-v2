## GEMINI DEEP THINK PROMPT — Find Best Video Production Solution

**Copy everything below this line and paste into Gemini Deep Think:**

---

I need you to do a deep, exhaustive research sweep to find me the absolute best way to produce three short promotional how-to videos for my tech startup. Here's the full brief:

### What I Need:
- **3 videos** for my curbside coffee ordering platform (pullupcoffee.com)
- **Video 1:** How a cafe signs up and starts receiving orders (30 seconds)
- **Video 2:** How an affiliate joins and earns commissions (30 seconds)
- **Video 3:** How a customer orders and picks up coffee (25 seconds)
- I have **polished scripts** with narration text and shot-by-shot visual direction for each
- Each video needs: **professional narration** (AI or human voice), **screen recordings** of the real website UI, **lifestyle/b-roll footage** (cafes, cars, people, phones), and **subtle background music**

### My Requirements:
1. **Professional, high-production quality** — this represents my brand. It needs to look like a funded startup made it, not a hobby project.
2. **Consistent brand feel** across all 3 videos — same colors (warm teal, deep navy, sage green), same fonts, same music style, same narration voice.
3. **20-30 seconds each** — suitable for website hero sections, YouTube pre-roll, Instagram Reels, and TikTok.
4. **Output:** MP4, 1080p minimum, 16:9. Bonus if they can also output 9:16 vertical cuts.
5. **Subtitles/captions** burnt in for accessibility and sound-off viewing.
6. **Budget:** Open to paying for quality. Up to **$500-1000 AUD total** for all 3 videos if needed. Could stretch to $1500 AUD if the quality jump is significant.
7. **Turnaround:** Ideally within 1-2 weeks. Faster is better.
8. **I have the scripts** — I literally have word-for-word narration and timestamp-by-timestamp visual direction. I need someone/something to EXECUTE them.

### What I've Found Frustrating:
- Most AI video generators (Runway, Pika, etc.) only produce 6-10 second clips and require endless frustrating iteration to get anything usable
- The quality is often "obviously AI" which doesn't represent a professional brand well
- Stitching together many short AI clips into a coherent 30-second video with consistent style is painful
- I want a **streamlined, professional process** — not hours of wrestling with half-baked AI tools

### What I Need You to Research (be thorough — check everything available as of March 2026):

**Category 1: AI Video Generation Platforms**
Search for and compare the BEST AI video tools that can produce 20-30 second promotional videos from a script. Consider:
- Runway Gen-3/Gen-4 (or latest)
- Pika Labs (latest version)
- OpenAI Sora (if publicly available)
- Google Veo / Veo 2
- Kling AI
- HeyGen (avatar-based)
- Synthesia (avatar-based)
- D-ID
- Minimax / Hailuo
- Any newer tools that launched since January 2026

For each, tell me: max video length, quality level, how much control I get, voice/narration capability, pricing, and whether it can do screen recording + b-roll + narration in one cohesive output.

**Category 2: AI-Powered Video Editing Platforms**
These combine stock footage, my screen recordings, AI narration, music, and templates:
- Pictory
- InVideo AI
- Descript
- Kapwing
- Lumen5
- Synthesia (for the editing/presentation side)
- Canva AI Video
- FlexClip
- Any newer 2026 tools

For each: can it handle screen recordings overlaid with b-roll? Does it have professional narration? Can I control timing precisely to match my script? Quality level? Pricing?

**Category 3: Human + AI Hybrid (Freelancers/Agencies)**
- Fiverr — what's the going rate and typical quality for "30-second promo video with screen recording and b-roll" from a top-rated seller?
- Upwork — same question for video production freelancers
- 90 Seconds (agency platform)
- Promo.com
- Vidyard
- Any AU-based video production agencies that specialize in startup promo content
- What's the typical cost and turnaround for 3x 30-second professional promo videos?

**Category 4: Best Workflow for My Specific Situation**
Given that I have:
- Polished scripts with exact narration text
- A live website I can screen-record
- Brand colors and guidelines
- Budget of $500-1500 AUD
- Need for 3 videos, ~30 seconds each
- Want professional quality, fast turnaround

What is the single BEST workflow from script → finished video? Walk me through step by step. Be specific about which tools/services to use and in what order.

### Deliverables I Want From You:

1. **Ranked comparison table** of the top 10 options across all categories, scored on: Quality (1-10), Cost, Turnaround, Control/Customization, Length Capability, and whether it handles my specific needs (screen recording + b-roll + narration + music).

2. **Your #1 recommendation** with reasoning — the single best option for my specific situation.

3. **Step-by-step instructions** for going from my scripts to finished videos using your #1 recommendation.

4. **Runner-up option** in case #1 doesn't work out.

5. **Any emerging platforms or approaches from late 2025 / early 2026** that I might not know about.

Be brutally honest about quality trade-offs. I'd rather pay more for genuinely professional output than save money on something that looks cheap. But I also don't want to overpay when an AI tool can genuinely match human quality now.
